        "question": "The child is declared as a dependent by the student's father, but the lease agreement is under the mother's Tax Identification Number (TIN). The two parents are married. Who should submit the application?",
        "answer": "The online application for the housing allowance must be submitted by the eligible beneficiary, meaning the person on whom the student is financially dependent, as defined by Article 11 of Law 4172/2013 (A’ 167). During the lease agreement step, if details of the other parent have been provided, their TIN may also be selected as the tenant. If the lease agreement cannot be verified electronically, the contract must be submitted to the relevant university office, where an authorized staff member will assess the related lease criteria in the online system."
